# Fireplace_thermometer
This project is designed to measure temperature in fireplace, but can be used to measure anything in interval from -30째C (-22째F) to 120째C (248째F) 

**There are two parts**: transmitter (measures temperatures and sends signal directly to another ESP) and **reciever** (recieves signal and displays it on OLED + turns specific LED on)
The distance between two ESPs in clear space can be up to 50 meters (tested) and about 15 meters inside house or with barriers.

## Used libraries:
**ESP8266WiFi**

**espnow**

**OneWire**

**DallasTemperature**

**U8g2lib**

## Circuit diagram
Reciever: recieves measured temperature from transmitter (wireless connection) attached display showing the measured value.

Transmitter: transmits signal using ESP-NOW protocol (needed MAC adress of reciever ESP8266) on physical and data-link layer (data and power efficient)

NOTE: Measured temperature is in degrees Celcius.
